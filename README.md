# Azure RTOS NetX

A high-performance implementation of TCP/IP protocol standards, Azure RTOS NetX is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all supported processors. It has a unique piconet architecture. Combined with a zero-copy API, it makes it a perfect fit for today’s deeply embedded applications that require network connectivity.

## Documentation

Documentation for this library can be found here: http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/rtos/netx

# Building and using the library

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools:

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.0 or later
* [GCC compilers for arm-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

## Cloning the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/azure-rtos/netx.git
```

## Building the threadx static library

Each component of Azure RTOS comes with a composible CMake-based build system that supports many different MCUs and host systems. Integrating any of these components into your device app code is as simple as adding a git submodule and then including it in your build using the CMake command `add_subdirectory()`.

While the typical usage pattern is to include threadx into your device code source tree to be built & linked with your code, you can compile threadx as a standalone static library to confirm your build is set up correctly.

```bash
$ cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/cortex_m4.cmake -GNinja .

$ cmake --build ./build
```
